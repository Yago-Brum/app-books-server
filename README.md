# Book Management API

This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books. It allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records stored in a JSON file. The API is built with Node.js and Express, demonstrating the **Facade design pattern** for better separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Get All Books**: Retrieve a list of all available books.
- **Get Book by ID**: Fetch details of a specific book using its ID.
- **Add New Book**: Create a new book entry.
- **Update Book**: Modify existing book details.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book record.
- **Facade Pattern Implementation**: Demonstrates a clean separation between the controllers and the underlying service logic.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **File System (fs) module**: For reading and writing data to a JSON file (acting as a simple database).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the API server:

```bash
node app.js
The API will be running on http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port you configure).

```

## API Endpoints

The API interacts with the `/books` resource.

| Method | Endpoint      | Description                          | Request Body Example (for POST/PATCH)             |
| :----- | :------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/books`      | Retrieves all books.                 | `N/A`                                             |
| `GET`  | `/books/:id`  | Retrieves a book by its ID.          | `N/A`                                             |
| `POST` | `/books`      | Adds a new book.                     | `{ "id": 1, "title": "The Great Book", "author": "John Doe" }` |
| `PATCH`| `/books/:id`  | Updates an existing book by ID.      | `{ "author": "Jane Smith" }`                      |
| `DELETE`|`/books/:id`  | Deletes a book by its ID.            | `N/A`                                             |

## Design Pattern

This project implements the **Facade design pattern**.

- The `bookFacade.js` acts as a simplified interface to the `services/book.js` subsystem.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Reduced Complexity**: Controllers interact with a high-level facade instead of multiple, low-level service functions.
    - **Decoupling**: Changes in the underlying data access logic (e.g., switching from JSON files to a database) would primarily require modifications only within the `services/book.js` and `facades/bookFacade.js`, without affecting the `controllers/books.js`.
    - **Improved Readability**: The purpose of the controller actions becomes clearer as they call semantically meaningful methods on the facade.
